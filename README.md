## 🏆 Two Captivating Tournaments
Brace yourself for excitement as you choose from two gripping tournament formats:

1. **Bracket Tournaments:** Channel your inner grandmaster in this knockout-style challenge. With player counts as powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64), every move matters. Triumph, and you advance. Falter, and the road ends. The arena is fierce, and only the strongest endure.

2. **Points Tournaments:** Craving strategic brilliance? Engage in a battle of wits where even-numbered players (excluding 0) vie for supremacy. Victories grant 2 points, draws earn 1, and losses, 0. Every participant faces off against all others in a single game, while rounds ensure every triumph and setback shapes the path forward.

## 🎮 Shared Tournament Features
Whether in brackets or points, the thrill unites in:

- **Match Access Button:** Dive into the action or spectate live matches with a single click.
- **Finish Button:** Claim victory and witness your progress right on the tournament site.
- **Abort Button:** No opponent? No problem. Secure a win if your opponent is a no-show within 10 minutes.
